 \section{Description}

 This software provides a "converter" that given appropritate input generates a result file compatible witht format used on \href{https://github.com/MCDMSociety}{MOrepo}.
 The software basically consists of a single class "MOrepoResultWriter". After constructing an object of the class, the simple "set" methods should be used to set the appropriate
 entries, and finally, after setting atleast all required entries and the output file path, the \texttt{writeFile ( )} function should be called.
 \hypertarget{index_Compiling}{}\section{Compiling}\label{index_Compiling}
The codes were compiled using the Visual Studio 2015 compiler on a Windows 10 machine. The following flags were used\+: /\+W3 /\+Ox /std\+:\mbox{[}c++14$\vert$c++latest\mbox{]}

 
   \section{Example of usage}
   This section contains an example showing how the \texttt{converter} class can be used to generate a MOrepo compatible json file. In this example we assume the instance
   is named "instance1", that the contribution is "Foo et al. 2017", and that the class dataReader has the appropriate get methods.

  \begin{lstlisting}
      // main.cpp
    #include"converter.h"
    #include"dataReader.h" // Assume you have written this yourself
    #include<vector>
    int main(int argc, char** argv){
        try{
            std::string aString;
            MOrepoResultWriter MOwriter = MOrepoResultWriter ( );

            aString = "1.0";
            MOwriter.setVersion ( aString );

            aString = "Gadegaard16_UFLP_Klose_p01_0";
            MOwriter.setInstanceName ( aString );
